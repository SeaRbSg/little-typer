## Organization:

We physically meet Tuesdays before the Weekly Hack night at Vivace or
Substantial. We also have a slack channel #study_typer for virtual
meetings.

## Tentative Schedule:

Here's a tentative schedule. For that week, we'll read through those
two chapters and discuss.

* Week 1: Kickoff!
* Week 2: Chapter 1 & 2
* Week 3: Chapter 3 & 4
* Week 4: Chapter 5
* Week 5: Chapter 6
* Week 6: Chapter 7
* Week 7: Chapter 8
* Week 8: Chapter 9
* Week 9: Chapter 10

(this is probably bullshit and needs review / editing)

## Project Structure:

Feel free to create a directory for your account name and submit any
code. Please make sure to follow Ryan's James Brown Guide to git
etiquette:

    [alias]
    down = pull --rebase
    onup = push

Now you too can join the James Brown school of git:

    git down && git onup

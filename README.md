(this is probably bullshit and needs review / editing)
(damn... 16 weeks seems like a LOT)

## Project Structure:

Feel free to create a directory for your account name and submit any
code.

Basic requests:

+ Please no merge commits, flat history is better.
+ Working in your own sub-directory means no conflicts.
+ Pull & rebase before you push so your history is consolidated.
+ Use PRs if you want to get extra reviews. Push directly otherwise.

Please make sure to follow Ryan's James Brown Guide to git
etiquette:

    [alias]
    down = pull --rebase
    onup = push

Now you too can join the James Brown school of git:

    git down && git onup

This will avoid the merge commits and auto-rebase for you.
